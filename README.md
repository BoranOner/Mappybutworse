Mappy is a XivLauncher/Dalamud plugin.

Mappy is a total replacement plugin for the ingame main map. This plugin is not intended to replace the games minimap.
Mappy offers a lot of customization options such as enabling and disabling specific icons, configuring colors of tooltips, or displayed areas.
Integrates seamlessly into the games built in functions, for example pressing `m` will open Mappy instead of the built in game map.

[[ Mappy has recently undergone a complete rework, new documentation is a work in progress ]]
